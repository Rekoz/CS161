1. Constraints:
   The prior probability of having the disease: 0.009
   The false positive for the test: 0.002
   The false negative for the test: 0.006

2. The most likely instantiation of all variables given that Sambot has sensed the lights to be on,
   but has sensed no bark.
   How: Enter query mode, set LightSensor = On and SoundSensor = Off, then run MPE computation.
   Result: Battery = OK
           SoundSensorHealth = OK
           LightSensorHealth = OK
           FamilyHome = No
           OutdoorLight = On
           HearableBarking = No
           ExpectingGuests = No
           DogOutside = Yes
           DogBowelTrouble = Yes
           DogBarking = No

   The most likely instantiation of the sensors given that the family is home and no guests
   are expected.
   How: Enter query mode, set FamilyHome = Yes and ExpectingGuests = No, then run MPE computation.
   Result: Battery = OK
           SoundSensorHealth = OK
           SoundSensor = Off
           LightSensorHealth = OK
           LightSensor = Off
           OutdoorLight = Off
           HearableBarking = No
           DogOutside = Yes
           DogBowelTrouble = Yes
           DogBarking = No

   The smallest set of variables Z in network such that the two sensors are independent
   given Z: {FamilyHome, Battery}
   Reason: both variables diverges into the sensors. Thus, the paths between LightSensor and
   SoundSensor are cut. The two variables are d-separated.

   The type of network constructed: Multiply-connected network.
